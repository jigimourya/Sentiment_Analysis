# Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on product reviews using machine learning techniques. It employs Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

## Features

• Sentiment classification using Naive Bayes and SVM.

• Preprocessing of raw text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.).

• Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings.

• Model evaluation and performance comparison.

• Research paper documenting methodologies and findings.

## Technologies Used

• Python

• Scikit-learn

• NLTK

• Pandas

• NumPy

• Matplotlib

• Jupyter Notebook


## Usage

• Load the dataset (product reviews CSV file).

• Preprocess the text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization).

• Extract features using TF-IDF.

• Train the Naive Bayes and SVM models.

• Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

• Predict sentiment for new product reviews.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of product reviews labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. You can use publicly available datasets like Amazon, Yelp, or IMDB reviews.

## Results

• Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification.

• SVM demonstrated better performance in certain cases compared to Naive Bayes.

• Preprocessing and feature extraction significantly improved model accuracy.

## Research Paper

The findings and methodologies used in this project are documented in a research paper. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the algorithms used, preprocessing techniques, and model performance.
